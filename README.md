# Dog Breed Identification Using Transfer Learning  

This project uses transfer learning with MobileNetV2 to classify dog breeds and provides a simple web interface for users to upload images and receive predictions.  

---

## Overview  
- **Model Training**: A Jupyter Notebook is provided to fine-tune the MobileNetV2 model on a labeled dog breed dataset.  
- **Web Application**: A Flask-based app allows users to upload images and get real-time breed predictions.  

---

## Features  
- Lightweight and efficient MobileNetV2 architecture.  
- Easy-to-use web interface for predictions.  
- Fully customizable for new datasets or additional features.  

---

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.7+  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akhil200331/Dog-Breed-Identification-Using-Transfer-Learning.git
   cd Dog-Breed-Identification-Using-Transfer-Learning

---

## Running the project
## 1.  Train the Model
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook dog-breed-using-mobilenetv2.ipynb.
   - Follow the steps to:
     A. Preprocess the dataset.
     B. Train the model using MobileNetV2.
     C. Save the trained model as model.h5.
## 2.  Run the Application
   - Ensure the trained model.h5 file is in the project directory.
   - Start the Flask app by python 3rd/app.py

As the model.h5 exceeds 25mb We are  unable to upload in git repo so I provide drive link of the file here
